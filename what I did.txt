forced app to give a root widget by 
```
    def build(self):
        Clock.schedule_once(self.test, 0)
        from kivy.lang import Builder
        root = Builder.load_file("F:\\CODING\\KivyProjects\\speedreader\\speed_read_r.kv")
        return root
```

next got "no module named kivymd.uix.screen", not sure it it worked next
